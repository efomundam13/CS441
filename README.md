Introduced basic mathematics, algorithms, and techniques underlying computer graphics. 
Creating static 3D images, user interfaces, and rudimentary 3D animations using the OpenGL software interface. 
Learned the mathematical tools necessary for displaying and manipulating images, mastered the use of the OpenGL interface, and understood both low-level and high-level graphics algorithms.
